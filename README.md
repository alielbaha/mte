Developed in the early 20th century by Robert C. Russell and Margaret K. Odell, the Soundex algorithm focuses on encoding names and words based on how they sound in English. Unlike traditional edit-distance metrics, Soundex prioritizes phonetic similarity, enabling it to handle variations in spelling that sound similar when spoken (e.g., "Smith" and "Smyth").



Soundex encodes words into a fixed-length alphanumeric code. The algorithm processes input strings as follows:
1. Retain the First Letter:
      - Keep the first letter of the word (converted to uppercase).

2. Encode the Remaining Letters using the following table




3.Remove Adjacent Duplicates

4. Exclude the letters A, E, I, O, U, H, W, and Y (unless they are the first letter)

5. Ensure the resulting code is exactly 4 characters by truncating digits or appending zeros.

Preprocessing:
Convert the input to uppercase.
Encoding Loop:
Iterate through the string to map and process each character.




Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
The Damerau-Levenshtein Distance extends the Levenshtein distance by including the transposition operation. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another, where the allowed operations are:

Insertions
Deletions
Substitutions
Transpositions (swapping two adjacent characters)
Mathematically, it is expressed as:


Where:

cost=0 if characters match, 1 otherwise.
Algorithmic Implementation
The Damerau-Levenshtein distance is implemented using a dynamic programming approach with an additional condition to handle transpositions.

Initialization:
Create a matrix D of size (m+1)×(n+1), where 𝑚 and 𝑛 are the lengths of the strings 𝑥 and 𝑦. Initialize the first row and column to represent the cost of transforming one string into an empty string.

Recursive Filling:
For each cell 

D[i][j], calculate the minimum cost among the four operations: insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition.

Result Extraction:
The value in 
𝐷[𝑚][𝑛] is the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between 𝑥 and 𝑦

Jaro Distance
The Jaro Distance measures the similarity between two strings. It is especially useful for comparing short strings, such as names. It considers matching characters and the number of transpositions.

The Jaro Distance is defined as:


Where:
∣𝑚∣ is the number of matching characters (characters that are the same and within a specific matching window).
∣𝑡∣ is half the number of transpositions (mismatched order of matched characters).
Algorithmic Implementation
Matching Window:
Define a window size as max(∣𝑥∣,∣𝑦∣)/2−1. 

Characters in one string can only be considered a match if they are within this window in the other string.

Counting Matches:
Identify matching characters within the matching window.

Calculating Transpositions:
Count the number of transpositions (mismatched order of matched characters).

Jaro Distance Calculation:
Use the formula above to compute the similarity score.

Jaro-Winkler Distance
The Jaro-Winkler Distance is an extension of the Jaro Distance, giving higher weight to common prefixes of the two strings. It is useful for short strings where matching prefixes are significant.

The Jaro-Winkler Distance is defined as:


Where:
𝐽(𝑥,𝑦) is the Jaro Distance.
𝑙 is the length of the common prefix (up to a maximum of 4 characters).
𝑝 is a constant scaling factor (usually 𝑝 = 0.1).
Algorithmic Implementation
Calculate Jaro Distance:
Follow the steps to compute 𝐽(𝑥,𝑦)

Determine Prefix Length:
Identify the number of matching characters at the start of the two strings, up to a maximum of 4 characters.

Apply Jaro-Winkler Adjustment:
Modify the Jaro Distance using the formula above.
