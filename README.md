takes into account the three fundamental editing operations - insertions, deletions and substitutions - in order to evaluate the dissimilarity between two strings.
Levenshtein distance is defined as the minimum number of single-character edits required to convert one string (洧논) into another (洧녽). Mathematically, it is expressed as:
$L(x, y)=\min \begin{cases}L(x-1, y)+1 & \text { (deletion) } \\ L(x, y-1)+1 & \text { (insertion) } \\ L(x-1, y-1)+\text { cost } & \text { (substitution, where cost = 0 if characters match, otherwise 1) }\end{cases}$

The distance is computed using dynamic programming, filling a two-dimensional matrix where each cell represents the distance for a substring pair






Algorithmic Implementation

The Levenshtein distance is commonly implemented using a dynamic programming approach.
Initialization:

Create a matrix 洧냥 of size (洧녴+1)칑(洧녵+1) where 洧녴 and 洧녵 are the lengths of 洧논 and 洧녽.
Initialize the first row and column to represent the cost of transforming one string to an empty string.
Recursive Filling:

For each cell 
洧냥[洧녰][洧녱] calculate the minimum of the three operations (insertion, deletion, substitution).
Result Extraction:

The value in 
洧냥[洧녴][洧녵] is the Levenshtein distance between 洧논 and 洧녽
