A transposition-only fuzzy matching metric measures the similarity of two strings by determining the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to transform one string into another. This metric is mathematically formalized as:

𝑇
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
Minimum adjacent transpositions needed to convert 
𝑥
 to 
𝑦
T(x,y)=Minimum adjacent transpositions needed to convert x to y
Key Characteristics:

Adjacency Constraint: Only adjacent characters are swapped, reflecting practical error patterns.
Symmetry: The metric is symmetric (
𝑇
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
𝑇
(
𝑦
,
𝑥
)
T(x,y)=T(y,x)).
Non-Negativity: 
𝑇
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
≥
0
T(x,y)≥0, with 
𝑇
(
𝑥
,
𝑥
)
=
0
T(x,x)=0.
The Damerau-Levenshtein distance, a superset of this metric, includes transpositions along with insertions, deletions, and substitutions. However, isolating transpositions simplifies computation in applicable contexts.

3. Algorithmic Implementation
The transposition-only metric can be computed using a modified sorting algorithm. One efficient approach leverages bubble sort, where the number of swaps is tracked:

Compare each character in the strings 
𝑥
x and 
𝑦
y.
Identify mismatches where characters are out of order.
Perform adjacent swaps to correct mismatches, incrementing a counter.
Stop when 
𝑥
x is transformed into 
𝑦
y.
Complexity:

Worst-case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n2), for bubble sort.
Optimized: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn) using merge sort adaptations, though less intuitive for adjacent swaps.
4. Comparative Analysis
The metric is most effective when transpositions dominate the error space. In contexts involving other operations, its isolated focus may limit accuracy. Compared to full-edit metrics:

Advantages: Reduced complexity, targeted evaluation.
Disadvantages: Inapplicability to diverse error types.
5. Applications
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Correcting transposed characters in noisy scans.
Typing Error Detection: Identifying and rectifying adjacent key swaps.
Bioinformatics: Analyzing short genomic sequences with prevalent transpositions.
6. Limitations
Does not account for insertions, deletions, or substitutions.
Computationally intensive for long strings without optimization.
Overemphasizes transpositions in mixed-error scenarios.
